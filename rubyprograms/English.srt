1
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,291
Ninety-one, 92....

2
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,961
-lt's down there.
-Where? If they catch us--

3
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,130
There's a million bottles
of booze in there.

4
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,840
You think they're gonna miss one?

5
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,190
Weather is with us, sir.

6
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,735
We arrive in port in a couple of hours.

7
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,529
Very good.

8
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,489
You're welcome, sir.

9
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,498
Man, l never smelt anything like this.
Not even when you're in the crapper.

10
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,918
Oh, what, your shit smells like roses?

11
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,420
Hey, look.

12
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,423
I'll give you a hand.

13
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,099
-Thought you said it was booze.
-That's what the papers said.

14
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,273
Captain, we have a breach
in lower level. Look.

15
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,066
-Which section?
-1 01 .

16
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,235
Fuck. Take the wheel.

17
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,820
-Yes, sir.
-Fuck.

18
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,116
Close the door! Get the masks.

19
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,458
Holy shit.

20
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,127
Take care of them.

21
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,340
-Morning.
-Passport, please.

22
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,014
Rough seas?

23
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,851
The sea was smooth. The party was
a bit rough, if you know what l mean.

24
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,603
-lbiza.
-Yeah.

25
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,230
Thanks.

26
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,660
When I was a kid,
my father used to take me fishing.

27
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,080
Never could figure out how he knew
where the fish were.

28
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,668
They were always exactly
where he said they would be.

29
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,819
Security check.

30
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,821
Do I look like a security risk?

31
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,158
Please step out of the car and bring
your documents to the office.

32
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,577
My documents are right here, sir.

33
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,912
The computer is in the office.

34
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,665
Her too.

35
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,542
She's sleeping.

36
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,503
-With her documents.
-Okay, sure.

37
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,561
You're gonna lose it.

38
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,776
Close, inspector, you're close.

39
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,574
That's a big one. Go left, go left.

40
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,953
Don't let him get away.

41
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,876
You're close.

42
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,758
Go left, go left! Go right!

43
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,639
Must be Moby Dick you hooked.
Need some help?

44
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,932
No, thank you, Frank.

45
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,478
I have been fishing these waters
since before you were born.

46
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,278
You were close, inspector.
You were close.

47
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,494
Good thing that we French have such
a highly developed sense of humor.

48
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,248
With all due respect, the French
think Jerry Lewis is a genius.

49
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,584
-Jerry Lewis is a genius.
-Dean was the genius.

50
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,838
No, Dean just stood there
with a drink and a cigarette.

51
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,007
My point exactly.
Anyone can fall down and get a laugh.

52
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,469
How many people can do it standing
still with a drink and a cigarette?

53
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,192
I am afraid our day of leisure
is cut short.

54
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,861
There is a mess in Marseilles.

55
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,947
Some madman driving an Audi
at impossible speeds.

56
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,410
Don't look at me.

57
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,496
That is the first place
the chief told me to look.

58
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,876
But l will tell him
you have the perfect alibi.

59
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,254
As usual.

60
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,178
Tarconi!

61
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,972
-Please!
-l am sorry, Frank.

62
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,267
-lt's our first bite!
-Yeah, yeah.

63
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,895
-Please.
-Yeah.

64
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,563
Stop the boat. Come on.

65
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,483
-No. No, Frank.
-Come on, please.

66
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,276
Purpose of your visit, Mr. Johnson?

67
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,070
Business.

68
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,863
What kind of business?

69
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,282
Environmental protection.

70
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,290
Thank you.

71
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,963
Mr. Minister, you're giving the opening
address at an EU conference...

72
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,882
...on environmental impact of industry
in Odessa tomorrow.

73
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,802
-What is top on your list of priorities?
-lt's a short list.

74
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,763
There's one item: the environment
and how to protect it.

75
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,765
In the face of increasing pressure...

76
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,893
...for industries to compete
successfully in a global economy...

77
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,438
...that goal can sometimes come up
against some very harsh realities.

78
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,608
Well, not as harsh as
a polluted and uninhabitable planet.

79
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,485
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me now...

80
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,905
...l have trees to save
and industrialists to disappoint.

81
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,828
-Your speech for tomorrow.
-Any good?

82
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,207
-lt's going to piss off a lot of people.
-Excellent.

83
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,356
Hello?

84
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,318
Mr. Minister?

85
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,361
Who is this?

86
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,031
My name is not important.

87
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,491
I've been put in charge of
the negotiations...

88
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,077
...you are engaged in with Ecocorp...

89
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,539
...for issuance of their license
to do business in the Ukraine.

90
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,208
You must be misinformed,
Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-ls.

91
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,502
I've terminated negotiations
permanently.

92
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,088
I think you will reconsider
that position...

93
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,717
...once you have a chance to study
the documents in the envelope.

94
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,567
I'll be in touch.

95
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,194
Yeah, there's been an accident.

96
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,906
Send an ambulance,
8 Route de la Falaise.

97
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,718
Malcolm.

98
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,594
Malcolm. Malcolm.

99
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,145
I asked you for your price.
What is this?

100
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:14,441
A man who might be interested
in taking the job. This man will.

101
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,818
My boss said you're the man
for the job.

102
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,653
Your boss got his facts wrong.

103
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,074
Two things you should know
about my boss:

104
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,494
He never gets his facts wrong,
he never takes no for an answer.

105
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,747
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

106
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,467
Well, not this time.

107
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,767
You don't wanna do this.

108
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,896
I don't think you're in a position to
tell me what l do and don't wanna do.

109
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,065
You have 1 0 seconds
to change your mind.

110
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,865
I'll give you five seconds
to remove your hand.

111
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,844
Malcolm. Malcolm.

112
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,053
You hear me?

113
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,058
Mal, I said drop in anytime,
but I didn't mean....

114
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,103
-Nowhere else to go.
-Just take it easy, okay?

115
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,064
Don't move me from the car.

116
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,235
-lt's just till the ambulance arrives.
-No ambulance.

117
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,030
You need a doctor, you've been shot.
I can't take care of this.

118
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,410
Not far from car.

119
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,954
Relax.

120
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,959
Just try to stay calm.
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

121
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,014
He's inside. Quick, it's serious.

122
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,603
Sir?

123
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,981
-You wanna be careful moving him.
-We know our job, okay?

124
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,692
Sir, can you hear me?

125
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,444
This car.... No....

126
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,154
If you hear me, press my hand.

127
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,906
The car....

128
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,041
Am l in heaven?

129
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,710
Actually, you're in a bit of the shit.

130
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,880
You'll help me out of it?

131
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,341
That depends on
how deep you're in.

132
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,844
-Don't trust anyone.
-Couldn't agree with you more.

133
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,640
-Come on.
-No! Don't leave the car!

134
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,018
-What's so special about the car?
-Not the car.

135
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,991
Wait!

136
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,770
I told you.

137
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,694
Don't trust anyone.

138
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,780
I told you.

139
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,460
I took the liberty
of bringing your suit.

140
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,837
It's what you wear when
you're working, correct?

141
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,673
Correct. But l'm not working.

142
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,344
-You see, boss? l told you.
-Please, Joseph.

143
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:21,015
Your approach was not very effective in
presenting our proposal the first time.

144
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,767
Thank you.

145
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,435
As l was saying...

146
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,772
...we came to you in good faith.
You said you were unavailable.

147
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,399
We contracted with the man
whose number you gave us.

148
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,151
He proved to be ineffective.

149
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,613
And now I am left
with unfinished business.

150
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,116
The way l see it, you're responsible.

151
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,660
I understand your point of view.

152
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,036
But l'm still unavailable.

153
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,540
Boss, can l say something?

154
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,586
Anyone else wanna say something?

155
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,258
Good.

156
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,552
Find me a smarter one.

157
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,931
You have three seconds
to change your mind...

158
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,892
...or you're gonna
be permanently unavailable.

159
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,103
One.

160
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,398
Two.

161
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,694
One condition.

162
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,323
I'm listening.

163
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,243
I drive my own car.

164
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,996
Deal.

165
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,711
In anticipation of your answer, we took
the liberty of bringing your car.

166
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,840
Changed the oil, gave it a tune-up,
took out all the non-essential material.

167
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,594
Left the switch-over license plates.
Love that.

168
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,054
Replaced the GPS
with one of our own.

169
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,098
Preprogrammed.
More efficient that way.

170
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,561
Why I was so insistent on using only
the best man for this assignment?

171
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,733
We're playing
in a much larger game here.

172
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:58,613
Don't think of this as just another job.
Think of it as a mission.

173
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,451
I'm so pleased to find we share
the same approach to our work.

174
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,745
I make a deal, that's the deal.
Just like you.

175
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,664
You don't like names. Neither do l.
We're both precise.

176
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,959
Neither one of us has any interest
in what we're paid to do...

177
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:16,130
...beyond what we are paid to do.
Those are your rules, right?

178
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,973
You forgot one.

179
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,477
-l work alone.
-l thought you might like the company.

180
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,230
Thought you wanted me
to complete a mission.

181
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,275
You're right. l do.

182
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,238
Wait.

183
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,075
What, you wanna change the rules?

184
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,454
Every rule has an exception.
Let's make one for today.

185
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,833
You're the boss.

186
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,630
Anything else?

187
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,091
The jewelry.
Anything I should know?

188
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,389
You remember those jokers
trying to blow up airliners...

189
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,433
...by sneaking liquids through
and combining them onboard?

190
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,519
Same principle, just refined.

191
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,437
Twenty-five feet from the car...

192
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,024
...yellow light comes on,
signaling the first liquid is ready.

193
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,026
Fifty feet, orange.

194
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,570
Second liquid
flows into the chamber.

195
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,740
Seventy-five feet,
you're gonna see red.

196
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,747
Time to go.

197
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,960
This phone is programmed
to call only one number, mine.

198
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,881
When you pass the first toll on the
road going north, call me, all right?

199
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,969
Money for gas and food.

200
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,387
Any other questions?

201
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,171
Would you mind
buckling your seat belt?

202
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,268
Don't suppose you wanna tell me
what this is all about?

203
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,942
Great.

204
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,252
Ocean Pearl
requesting cargo clearance.

205
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,465
The papers are with
the environmental agency.

206
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,759
Drop anchor and wait to dock.

207
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,595
-We'll inform you when they're signed.
-Okay.

208
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,856
I know what happened to you.

209
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,317
But what happened to Frank?

210
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,160
Colonel Medved over at lntelligence
has been given all the information.

211
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,162
He knows it's top priority.

212
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,915
He wants you to know
he has his best men on it.

213
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,292
He'll keep it out of official channels.

214
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,171
He suggests you buy
as much time as you can.

215
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:44,315
Look, l don't know what your part in all
this is or isn't. And l don't really care.

216
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,817
You were here first,
you know more than l do...

217
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,736
...download me on what you know.

218
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,488
I know nothing.

219
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,907
How did you know Malcolm?

220
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,325
I didn't.

221
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,745
You just happened to end up in a car
with a man you don't know?

222
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,041
I'm now in a car
with man l don't know.

223
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,545
Aren't you supposed to make a call?

224
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,386
Nice to hear from you.

225
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,640
You can skip the pleasantries.
Just give me the code.

226
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,600
1-1-2-6.

227
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,273
Call me when you arrive.

228
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,444
What's in Budapest?

229
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,905
Goulash. Beer.

230
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,121
All right.

231
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,124
Let's rewind here,
start with the proper introductions.

232
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,294
What happened
to the rule of no names?

233
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,589
I'm suspending that rule
for the moment.

234
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,844
I'm Frank Martin.

235
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,598
And your name is?

236
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,145
What matters, my name?

237
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,649
Well, we're in this situation together.

238
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,776
No.

239
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,157
We're sitting here with two exploding
bracelets on, going to the same place.

240
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,286
I'd call that being
in the same situation.

241
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,330
It's not. They are going to kill you.

242
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,334
I'm aware of that.

243
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,297
In all probability, after they kill me,
you're next on the list.

244
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:35,009
Now, if l'm gonna keep that from
happening, I'm gonna need a little help.

245
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,845
From the top. We have this problem.

246
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,014
You think I don't know
it's a problem?

247
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,349
I look stupid to you?

248
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,561
I didn't say you were stupid.

249
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,689
But we have a problem...

250
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,526
...and you're not being very helpful
in participating in the solution of it.

251
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,488
I don't want to talk anymore.

252
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,122
Fine.

253
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,220
What did you say your name was?

254
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,183
Frank. Frank Martin.

255
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,311
Frank Martin.

256
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,730
Valentina.

257
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,277
Pleased to meet you.

258
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,460
The gentlemen
from Ecocorp are here.

259
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,088
Show them in.

260
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,888
Gentlemen.

261
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,685
Mr. Minister.

262
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,771
We'd like to thank you for
reconsidering our proposal...

263
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,899
-...on such short notice.
-You make it very hard not to.

264
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,737
Well, yes. We do have a reputation
of not taking no for an answer.

265
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,156
Here are the contracts.

266
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,075
All in order.

267
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,953
We were told the ships
couldn't be cleared...

268
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,164
...unless you personally
signed off on them.

269
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,665
Ships?

270
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,667
I thought there was only one.

271
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,336
Oh, well, here's the thing.

272
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,298
In order to make the venture
more profitable...

273
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,468
...we need to process the material
in a volume that makes sense.

274
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,303
How many ships
are we talking about?

275
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,265
Plus the one in the port
waiting on clearance, eight.

276
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,100
Eight.

277
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,643
This year.

278
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,939
Protecting the environment
is a long-term commitment.

279
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,150
You've said so yourself, haven't you?

280
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,861
And l will do again tomorrow
in Odessa...

281
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,947
...where I will sign these.

282
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,701
We were really hoping to
settle this today.

283
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:52,247
I want to review them, now that
there are some addendums.

284
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,625
Twenty-four hours
doesn't make a difference...

285
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,211
...on such a long-term
commitment, will it?

286
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,672
No, of course not.

287
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,885
Then l will see you tomorrow
in Odessa. Let's say 9 a.m.

288
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,142
Yes.

289
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,061
Okay, l'll stay.

290
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,896
-But the material is leaking.
-And?

291
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,690
-We won't be able to hide it.
-l'll take care of it.

292
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,192
If ever they check....

293
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,694
Easy. The deal will be closed
very soon.

294
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,530
Twenty-four hours. No more.

295
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:37,417
-Yes?
-l've bought you another 24 hours.

296
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,920
You have until tomorrow, 9 a.m.

297
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,922
That should be
more than enough time.

298
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,383
Do you have a lead?

299
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,385
Better than a lead.

300
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,220
A location.

301
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,760
I'm hungry.

302
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,306
We're 1 00 kilometers
from beer and sausage.

303
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,143
I don't like sausage.

304
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,898
What would you like?

305
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,695
Veal.

306
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,822
Roast, with carrots...

307
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,449
...and beets.

308
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,078
In gravy, with Madeira in stock.

309
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,538
Nothing to start?

310
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,085
A salad.

311
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,964
Greens tossed with balsamic.

312
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,925
From Modena.

313
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,509
Aged?

314
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,678
Of course, aged.

315
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,725
And for dessert?

316
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,603
Sachertorte.

317
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,648
With whipped cream or without?

318
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,359
With.

319
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,986
To drink?

320
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,114
Wine.

321
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,116
Tokaj, perhaps?

322
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,701
Ice wine.

323
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,704
Of course.

324
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,386
-What are you doing?
-Seeing a man about some jewelry.

325
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,649
He's gone off the reservation.

326
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,321
Send someone to get him back on.

327
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,907
Don't kill him.

328
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,270
Frank. lt's so good to see you,
mein Freund.

329
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,856
Good to see you too, Otto.

330
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,734
You didn't mention
you bring company.

331
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,402
It's not really company.

332
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,571
It's...

333
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,865
...complicated.

334
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,035
With you, it's always complicated.
You can tell me about it...

335
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,955
...over a nice schnitzel
with Kartoffelsalat I have prepared.

336
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,791
Hey, Otto, you know
I love your schnitzel...

337
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,419
...but we need to get rid of this first.

338
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,425
Binary free-form
magnetic-resolution technology.

339
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,135
English, please, Otto.

340
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,597
There's a program the
Pentagon has funded...

341
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,892
...through one of their
subsidiary front companies...

342
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,437
...that's been experimenting with
this new kind of weaponry...

343
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,273
...based on the theory
of magnetic attraction.

344
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,484
Very hush-hush stuff.

345
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,072
I didn't realize you were in the loop
on the Pentagon hush-hush.

346
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,324
You wouldn't believe
what you can discover...

347
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,659
...walking through the Internet.

348
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,120
You wanna see the
invasion plans for lran?

349
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,331
Maybe some other time.

350
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,959
Right now we need to get this thing off
without blowing myself to lran.

351
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,587
I don't wanna bother you
with the details...

352
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:55,342
...but usually there's
a transmitter plate close by.

353
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,016
You should not be doing this.

354
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,185
First you don't talk,
now you offer advice.

355
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,854
Not advice. A warning.

356
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,981
Well, a little late for warnings,
don't you think?

357
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,198
I agree with you.

358
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,371
You're off course.

359
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,088
-Should l?
-Yeah, you should.

360
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,679
Look, fellas...

361
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,391
...some things in the car
were a bit off, needed checking.

362
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,145
In my profession,
a man is only as good as the car.

363
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,565
You take care of the car,
the car will take care of you.

364
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,069
The boss says, "Back on the road."

365
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,904
Frank?

366
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,698
Keep at it.

367
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,577
Back in the car, Frank.

368
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,453
No.

369
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,944
-Find it?
-Not yet.

370
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,272
You're the smart one?

371
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,066
No. I'm the big one.

372
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,578
Not so big anymore, are you?

373
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,977
Found it.

374
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,734
-The transmitter.
-Can you remove it?

375
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,238
It's wired.

376
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,573
If l do:

377
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,550
You fight good.

378
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,722
But you tie bad.

379
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,353
Where are you going?

380
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,647
Tired.

381
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,067
That's why I prefer to deal with cars.

382
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,570
That makes two of us.

383
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,073
What do you want me to do
when they--? When they wake up?

384
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,368
Probably best to take
the rest of the day off.

385
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,846
I'm not amused.

386
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,932
You'd be less amused
if you ended up dead.

387
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,518
If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
You need me.

388
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,521
You want me to complete the job,
I need some clarification.

389
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:07,273
I'm listening.

390
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,858
In person.

391
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,485
We've already done in person.

392
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,779
Well, not to my satisfaction,
apparently.

393
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,449
Right now, my satisfaction
should be your main concern.

394
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,078
Same place. One hour.
Wait for my call.

395
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,011
Hello?

396
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,179
You've disappointed me.

397
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:23,433
You won't be the first
and you won't be the last.

398
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:28,396
-l told you l wanted to do this in person.
-That won't be necessary. You see...

399
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,690
...since our little chat
at the beginning...

400
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,360
...l've been thinking l don't need
the best for this mundane assignment.

401
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,738
Any idiot with
a driver's license will do.

402
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,991
So in the words of the
great American, Donald Trump:

403
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,536
I'm sorry, but you're fired.

404
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,917
Who are you?

405
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,920
-Your new chauffeur.
-l want the old one back.

406
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,422
He's about to go to pieces.

407
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,242
You're fired.

408
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,122
How was your nap?

409
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,875
Restful. How was your phone call?

410
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,544
Brief. Fasten your seat belt.

411
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,474
Tarconi.

412
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,683
It's me.

413
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,603
I was wondering
when you would call.

414
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,021
I've been busy.

415
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,857
Let me guess. ln Budapest?

416
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,443
You've been busy too.

417
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,780
Never a problem keeping that way
with a friend like you.

418
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,824
So l don't have to be redundant,
tell me what you know.

419
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,452
There is a black Mercedes
also in Budapest.

420
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,704
Probably not occupied
by friends of yours.

421
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,540
That is what I know.
Now tell me what you know.

422
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,711
I have two bags in the back
and a girl in the front.

423
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,797
Russian, I think.

424
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,216
I don't know what she
has to do with anything.

425
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,384
Have you tried asking her?

426
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,637
-Now, why didn't l think of that?
-Sorry.

427
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,555
Of course you've asked.
And she says?

428
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,474
I'm going to die.

429
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,976
Typical. Russians.

430
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,395
They are so dark.

431
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,066
I remember, in school,
reading Dostoyevsky and thinking...

432
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,944
...when do these people laugh?

433
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,821
One page after the other...

434
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,990
...misery and suffering
like you wouldn't believe, Frank.

435
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,577
Inspector, can we save the
literature lesson? l'm blinking here.

436
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,995
Is that code?

437
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,375
No, it's some bracelet
they accessorized us with.

438
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,794
Wired to explode
if we get too far from the car.

439
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,003
They?

440
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,755
Some American.

441
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,800
Can you be more specific?
A name? A number?

442
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,051
Nothing.

443
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,428
Why do you always
make it so easy, Frank?

444
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,347
It's my nature.

445
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,391
Where are you? I will come there.

446
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,060
That's not a good idea.
They have me on a short leash.

447
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,105
I can't be of much help
if you do not give me something.

448
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,859
How close are you to a computer?

449
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,780
Yes, Frank?

450
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,783
That wasn't very nice,
back there in the market.

451
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,786
You were the one
who broke the rules, not me.

452
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,080
Point well taken.

453
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,876
That makes us even. What say
we start with a clean slate?

454
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,212
So this call is about
kiss-and-make-up, then?

455
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,922
More or less.

456
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,009
You have what l need
to get the bracelet off...

457
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,053
...l have the packages
you need delivered.

458
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,640
Here are the new coordinates,
then: 2-6-1 2.

459
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,475
That'll take you to the place...

460
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,978
...where we can have a
conclusion to this business.

461
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,938
I look forward to it.

462
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,237
Frank.

463
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,655
Did you get it?

464
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,579
Got the signal. Give us a little time...

465
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,998
...and we should have his number
and location.

466
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,126
Your new phone, sir.

467
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,968
-Anything else?
-No.

468
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,184
Frank, do you know where
the signal is taking you?

469
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,698
I know restaurant there.
Fish like you never had.

470
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,035
Roasted with small carrots
and black pepper.

471
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,829
Romanian wine, not so good.

472
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,250
But for the last meal,
could be worse.

473
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,048
You really should begin
to think more positive.

474
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,592
I'm realist.

475
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,222
My friend was right when he said
you were doom and gloom.

476
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,266
What means "doom and gloom"?

477
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:42,395
You know, you only see
the horrible and the terrible.

478
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,564
Your friend, where does he get this?
He doesn't know me.

479
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:49,068
He was talking about you in general.
Russians, as a people.

480
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,404
I'm not Russian. l'm Ukrainian.

481
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,197
Excuse me.

482
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:57,451
Not excused. We're different people.
We're different here...

483
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,828
...and here.

484
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:08,504
Me, personally, I think there's
a little bit of an optimist in you.

485
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,466
How you can make such a statement?
You don't know me.

486
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,804
Well, l see
you're putting makeup on.

487
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,516
If you were so convinced
we was gonna die, why bother?

488
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,480
What does looking good
have to do with dying?

489
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,364
Hello.

490
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,533
What's that?

491
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,202
Souvenirs from lbiza.
Do you want one?

492
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,539
No, thank you. And neither do you.
We need to stay sharp.

493
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,293
Okay.

494
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,924
You stay sharp.

495
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,969
I stay, how you say? Optimist?

496
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,806
Give me that.
Give me that thing. Give me the pill!

497
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,394
Give me that--

498
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,651
Jesus.

499
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,739
Great.

500
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:22,119
-Just great.
-Come on, Frank Martin, lighten up.

501
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,163
I should?
How about when those pills hit?

502
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,999
You're gonna be lighting up
like a goddamn Christmas tree.

503
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,292
That would be nice.

504
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,337
Boring. Boring. Boring?

505
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,464
Oh, yeah.

506
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,504
You should stay in the car.

507
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,173
You want me to pee in car?

508
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,639
Okay. Go on.

509
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,894
You remember.

510
00:52:55,088 --> 00:53:22,156
Don't.

511
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:43,802
Oh, no.

512
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:25,511
-Stop, all right?
-Why? l don't drive.

513
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:26,971
I want to have fun.

514
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:30,516
I want to be happy. You should
try happy instead of so serious.

515
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,852
It's important to stay positive,
like you say, yeah?

516
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:37,273
-Drink with me, Frankie.
-l don't want a drink.

517
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,528
Now who is all gloomy and doomy?

518
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,697
I say it right? Gloomy doomy?

519
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,866
Come on, get in the car.

520
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,036
I am free, like a bird.

521
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,796
The girl! Come on! Faster!

522
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,182
-l have lost my friend!
-l'll buy you a new one.

523
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,574
Have any idea
why we have a car on our ass?

524
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,243
I don't know. l don't care.

525
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,998
-You mind?
-First you say I'm doom and gloom...

526
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,043
...and now you tell me do not
be happy? Make up your mind.

527
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,178
-Yes, Frank?
-l thought we had an agreement.

528
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,638
We do.

529
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,723
It had nothing to do
with a car on my ass.

530
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:40,813
I don't have anything to do with that.
Someone else has issues with you?

531
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,815
Likely.

532
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,904
What l think is that there are
other forces at work here.

533
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,490
Let me check into it,
see what l can find out.

534
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,325
What do I do in the meantime?

535
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,661
Drive faster.

536
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,447
What the hell is he doing?

537
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,261
There!

538
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,846
He's down there!

539
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,728
I'm hungry.

540
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,105
Should have thought
about a sandwich, not vodka.

541
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,400
Look!

542
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,951
I wasn't hungry then, l was thirsty.

543
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,786
Why you are so mean to me?

544
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:05,290
-l'm not being mean. I'm preoccupied.
-What means "preoccupied"?

545
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,548
That means preoccupied.

546
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,270
Shoot the tires! Come on! Get him!

547
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,649
-Get down!
-Shoot him!

548
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,661
Bloody hell!

549
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:53,964
Faster!

550
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,014
Stop the car!

551
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,141
Oh, shit!

552
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,540
What are you doing?

553
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,209
You're so tense.

554
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,628
You don't say.

555
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,884
I make you relax, okay?

556
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,055
-Yeah.
-l'm good at this.

557
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,766
Making tense go away.

558
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,943
What are you doing?

559
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:42,906
I want to feel sex
one more time before l die.

560
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,574
Don't you?

561
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,287
What is it with you and dying?

562
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,375
There is something wrong with me?

563
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,252
Am l not sexy?

564
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:57,754
Yeah, you're sexy.

565
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:04,803
You're the gay.

566
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,307
Nope, I am not the gay.

567
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,435
I don't mind.

568
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,980
I'm not, okay?

569
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,068
Then what's the problem?

570
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:25,991
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe I'm not in the mood?

571
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,845
-l thought rule is don't open package.
-lt is.

572
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,722
Why you have rules
if you break them?

573
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,683
I keep asking myself the same thing.

574
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,187
Phone books.

575
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,989
-You're the package.
-Yes.

576
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,366
Could have said something.

577
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,536
-Would it make a difference?
-Yes.

578
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,956
Now what are you doing?

579
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,584
You know, back in garage...

580
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:22,672
...it was very turn-on to me
when you take off your clothes.

581
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,550
I was trying to keep five cretins
from caving my head in.

582
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,177
I don't see the turn-on in that.

583
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:32,432
You think it's only man
gets turned on by striptease?

584
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,684
I don't like where this
is going, Valentina.

585
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:37,854
Would you striptease for me again?

586
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,191
Give me the keys. This is not funny.

587
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,526
You want keys?

588
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:49,366
I want you to stop playing around,
is what I want.

589
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,828
Maybe it's last chance to
play around for you and for me.

590
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,539
This is not the time
or the place for playing.

591
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:59,793
Why do l get feeling with you
it's never time or place?

592
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,295
If l wanna get analyzed,
I'll see a psychiatrist.

593
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:04,756
Now, give me the keys.

594
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,592
Come on, Frank Martin.

595
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,053
Make playtime for me.

596
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,617
All right? That enough?

597
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:35,579
Not enough.
That is not a striptease, Frank.

598
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:39,291
Striptease is sexy.
You know, move your ass a little.

599
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,626
Come on, Frank Martin.

600
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,837
You want keys?

601
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,048
I want strip.

602
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,849
You know what l'm gonna do to you
for making me do this?

603
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,475
Spank me?

604
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,311
For starters.

605
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:02,105
-Tie me up?
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?

606
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:06,151
I like the rough stuff.

607
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,531
Really?

608
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,622
Oh, but not too rough.

609
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,000
Deal was a striptease for the keys.

610
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,670
New deal. Kiss me for the keys.

611
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,679
Like you mean it.

612
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:44,064
Do you ever kiss
like you mean it, Frank?

613
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,567
I'm thinking maybe not.

614
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,028
I'm thinking you live alone.

615
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,989
Inside and outside.

616
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,743
Thinking it is not dying
you're afraid of.

617
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,828
It's living.

618
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,622
Live with me.

619
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,582
Just this once.

620
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:06,252
Just this moment. Live with me.

621
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,505
-What's his position?
-We lost him.

622
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:56,594
He headed into the mountains.
We can't get reception up there.

623
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,180
Hack into one of the
military satellites.

624
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,480
Yes.

625
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,941
You think we're playing games here,
Mr. Minister?

626
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,943
I don't know what
you're talking about.

627
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,488
I'm talking about a black car full of
your incompetent operatives.

628
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:18,783
One more move like that and you will
never see your daughter again.

629
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,368
I want to hear her voice.

630
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,204
When the contract
is signed and delivered.

631
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,790
I will not sign until I hear her voice.

632
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,626
You are in no position
to play hardball, Mr. Minister.

633
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,463
Well, neither are you, Mr. Johnson.

634
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,299
Yes, I know who you are.

635
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:37,719
And l can assure you, if anything
happens to my daughter...

636
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,804
...l will use all the power l have.

637
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:45,435
I will hunt you down and make you pay
in a most hideous way for this.

638
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,065
We have to move now.

639
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,947
Pick up, Frank. Pick up.

640
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,634
I'm in lbiza. Making holiday.

641
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,183
Someone hands me
glass of champagne.

642
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,185
I drink.

643
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:30,396
Then I don't feel so good.

644
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,496
I go to bathroom, and next thing,
I'm awake in the car.

645
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:51,501
I ask him, "Where is this?"
He tells me he's just a transporter.

646
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,715
He's pretty good driver.

647
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,844
Not like you good.

648
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:07,725
I tell him, "Please.
My father a really powerful man.

649
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:12,313
Big influence. Knows a lot of people.
Let me call him."

650
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:15,066
He's afraid.
He's never done this before.

651
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:20,405
It's supposed to be simple.
Pick up, drop off. Easy money.

652
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:23,950
He's been told no calls,
never leave car.

653
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,327
But l convince him.

654
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,873
I call.

655
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,750
But before I say to my father
where we are....

656
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:34,252
Inside the car. Come on!

657
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,594
We get away, but....

658
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,433
There's people shooting at us. Why?

659
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,768
Why they shooting at us?

660
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:55,899
He says they shoot because
we didn't go according to plan.

661
01:09:56,233 --> 01:10:00,737
I said, "Okay, that's the old plan.
What's new plan?"

662
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,239
He says he has a friend.

663
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,459
And then I met you.

664
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,923
And then I feel it's gonna be okay.

665
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,763
You didn't even know me.

666
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,890
Of course I don't know you.

667
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:32,602
I talk about feelings, not knowing.

668
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:39,067
Well, if you was feeling that way, you
sure had a funny way of showing it.

669
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:43,446
Better for a woman
to have a little mystery to her.

670
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,114
No?

671
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,159
No.

672
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,996
Yes. Just a little.

673
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,566
He's back on the radar, sir.

674
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:27,532
-Yeah.
-Where the hell are you?

675
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,908
On the way to Bucharest.

676
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,660
Not any longer.

677
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:36,332
New coordinates: 3-7-1 3.

678
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,039
Excuse me, Mr. Minister.

679
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:18,875
Sorry, just a minute.

680
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,169
Inspector Tarconi, from Marseilles.

681
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,048
Well, not exactly Marseilles...

682
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:28,176
-...but a small town to the east--
-What do you want, inspector?

683
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,053
-A word with you.
-l have no time.

684
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,513
It's about your daughter.

685
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,400
Odessa, Frank. My country.

686
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:48,154
You take me home. Thank you.

687
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,116
What happened to Bucharest?

688
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:58,581
-Change of plans.
-lt's a good change. l prefer Odessa.

689
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,833
Yeah.

690
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:04,921
I was looking forward to that fish
with the carrots myself.

691
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,131
Oh, it's much better here.

692
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:10,426
-You know chicken Kiev?
-l do.

693
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,804
I know restaurant here.

694
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,347
Best in the world.

695
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:18,893
The chicken's so fresh.
And the butter, when it's coming out....

696
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,229
Like you cannot believe, it's so nice.

697
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,362
You know what l feel like now?

698
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,699
Hungry.

699
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,579
Safe.

700
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:51,050
It's going to end up like the movies,
this happily ever after?

701
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,348
By tonight, this is all
gonna be a fading memory.

702
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:01,853
It's gonna be you and me,
laughing over chicken Kiev.

703
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,481
Liar.

704
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,710
Mr. Minister, an update, please.

705
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:31,841
I am ready to sign the contract
once I speak to my daughter.

706
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,554
Hello? Hello?

707
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:39,724
Have that pen ready.
I'll call you back.

708
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:50,568
-Yeah.
-We are closing the noose, Frank.

709
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:54,489
Well, when it closes, make sure
no one tries to drag me out of the car.

710
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,240
You know what this is about yet?

711
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:59,952
The girl. Her father.

712
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:02,830
Large amounts of toxic waste.

713
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,374
It is a trade.
His signature for her life.

714
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:10,171
I have a reputation
to uphold here, inspector.

715
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,591
One hundred percent
successful delivery rate.

716
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:17,261
Am l detecting a little attachment?

717
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:23,059
That is not the Frank I know. With his
rules, no names, no attachment.

718
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,436
Why is everyone so concerned
about my rules?

719
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:31,776
Frank, l always suspected
you are a romantic at heart.

720
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:34,737
Anything else?

721
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,615
Where is the rendezvous?

722
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,742
I'll call you back.

723
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:47,124
-Yeah.
-We're almost at the end, Frank.

724
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,877
-Just give me the coordinates.
-No more coordinates.

725
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,588
The road you're on.

726
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,257
Make your first left.

727
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:56,551
I'd like to know where l'm going.

728
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,808
You'll know when you get there.

729
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:36,090
Don't worry. We got them
right where we want them.

730
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,016
My compliments, Frank.

731
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:48,853
Our trust in your abilities
was well deserved.

732
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,188
If you could please
send the girl out.

733
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,358
She's coming.

734
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,861
I'm not coming.

735
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,697
They need you. They won't kill you.

736
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,199
But they will kill you.

737
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,995
Do I look like a man who came halfway
across Europe to die on a bridge?

738
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:09,206
Do I?

739
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,968
We don't have all day, Frank.

740
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:26,390
Look how many of them.

741
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,517
They have all the guns.

742
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:29,894
How it's gonna be okay?

743
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,358
Tell you over dinner.

744
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,235
Now, go.

745
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,404
Go.

746
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,365
Kiss me.

747
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:00,758
Go.

748
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:08,182
You're gonna get me killed. Now, go.

749
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,084
Get to her, you bastard.

750
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,486
Better now, darling?

751
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,465
Finish him.

752
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,278
No! Frank!

753
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:58,042
His beloved car will be his grave.

754
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,128
Leaves it, he blows. Stays, he drowns.
Let's get out of here.

755
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:14,391
-Tarconi.
-They have the girl.

756
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:19,063
Frank, we are trying to track him
through the phone signal.

757
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:21,524
-Where are you?
-ln a lake.

758
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,401
A lake?

759
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:26,737
Can you be more specific?

760
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,239
There's a dam.

761
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:31,826
-A dam?
-l know the place, sir.

762
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,828
-How far?
-Ten minutes at least.

763
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:35,913
Frank, we'll be there in 1 0 minutes.

764
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,414
Can you make it any faster?

765
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,167
-We'll do our best.
-Thank you.

766
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:40,120
Buy tickets for all of us.

767
01:22:40,705 --> 01:22:42,122
Where to?

768
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,251
Anywhere this train is going. We need
to keep moving for half an hour.

769
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:48,379
Why don't we just keep
driving around?

770
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:55,427
Another day.

771
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:12,444
Sir! There!

772
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:33,841
-Out. Out!
-Everybody out!

773
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,426
-Come on.
-Move!

774
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,761
Move, quick!

775
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,406
-Mr. Minister?
-Yes.

776
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,742
Someone wants to talk to you.

777
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,746
-Papa.
-Are you all right?

778
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:09,960
Don't sign.

779
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:13,756
What you have is 1 5 minutes.

780
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:23,724
-You ever find out what this is about?
-Garbage.

781
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,476
How much garbage are we talking?

782
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:29,980
Enough to pollute half the country
for a hundred years.

783
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,148
Try it again.

784
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:55,214
For a modern woman,
you are very uninformed.

785
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:57,174
This is the new world.

786
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,594
There are no more countries.
That's old think.

787
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:04,389
There are just economic realities.
Profit and loss.

788
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:07,351
Efficiency and waste.

789
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,520
Think global, not local.

790
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:12,272
Think this.

791
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:29,039
-Yes?
-Where are we?

792
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:38,173
We're almost there.

793
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,177
Where?

794
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:44,388
Here. He is on a train.

795
01:25:45,014 --> 01:25:47,391
-And where are we?
-Here.

796
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,768
We can get units there.

797
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,230
That's a good idea. Do that.

798
01:25:57,193 --> 01:26:00,070
Oh, Frank, come on.

799
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,521
Mr. Minister, l assure you,
everything is in order.

800
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,607
I'm sure it is.

801
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:40,861
-lf there are any problems....
-l know you will solve them.

802
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,697
Now, if you don't mind....

803
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:17,648
You might not believe this,
but I am, at heart, a pacifist.

804
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:20,984
I hate violence.

805
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:25,781
It creates more problems
than it solves.

806
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:30,244
You know, I never wanted
to do any of this.

807
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:34,831
A client asked me to obtain a result...

808
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,376
...so l went about creating
an environment...

809
01:27:37,543 --> 01:27:39,336
...with the least amount
of bloodshed.

810
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:42,297
No one wanted to cooperate.
Not you, not the first driver...

811
01:27:42,465 --> 01:27:46,260
...not your father, not the
recently deceased Frank Martin.

812
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,972
Everyone wanted to fight.

813
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:06,530
What's so funny?

814
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:10,284
Hearing a dead man talking.

815
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,085
One more step, Frank.

816
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,045
Come on. One more.

817
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:12,090
Look.

818
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:13,508
It's over.

819
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,052
Two minutes to 9. He signed.

820
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:21,975
Oh, my God.

821
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:28,690
No, Frank. No, no.

822
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,108
It's over, Frank. lt's over.

823
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,862
Mission accomplished.
You and the girl are free to go.

824
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:19,783
Matter of fact,
I'm so impressed by your talent...

825
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,660
...l'd like to offer you a position.

826
01:32:21,827 --> 01:32:25,163
I'd like to offer you one.
Permanently disabled.

827
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:45,809
I hate to waste talent.

828
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,311
But l really don't think
we'd make a very good fit.

829
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:49,980
That's right.

830
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:14,879
No!

831
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:22,012
We wouldn't fit, but you and the
bracelet were made for each other.

832
01:33:26,517 --> 01:33:27,851
No, no.

833
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:43,033
No!

834
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,634
You're doing the right thing.

835
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:28,578
Valentina.

836
01:34:38,881 --> 01:34:41,049
Am l in heaven?

837
01:34:44,136 --> 01:34:46,429
Looks more like we're in hell.

838
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:48,765
I don't care.

839
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:50,767
As long as we're there together.

840
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:04,155
Yes?

841
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:07,534
Mr. Minister,
your daughter is in good hands.

842
01:35:08,994 --> 01:35:10,620
Thank you.

843
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:27,554
-What are you doing?
-What you said, the right thing.

844
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:30,974
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a conference to address...

845
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:34,144
...on the dangers of doing business
with people like you.

846
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:35,311
Thank you very much.

847
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:55,540
Is the launch ready?

848
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:58,084
-lt's on the water, sir, waiting.
-Time to leave.

849
01:35:58,794 --> 01:36:00,170
-Grab the log.
-Okay.

850
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:22,150
I just don't understand it.

851
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,319
When I was a boy, my father and I...

852
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:27,864
...used to pull fish out of
this very spot all day long.

853
01:36:28,032 --> 01:36:29,699
Times change, inspector.

854
01:36:30,242 --> 01:36:32,035
As do people.

855
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,956
You referring to me?

856
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,627
I don't think that's
a very accurate statement.

857
01:36:41,545 --> 01:36:43,797
I drive the same car,
live in the same house.

858
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:48,134
Oh, l was not referring
to your car or your house.

859
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:53,389
The sea is so restful.

860
01:36:53,557 --> 01:36:54,724
Is lunch ready yet?

861
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:59,312
Mademoiselle, there is
a certain progression to things.

862
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,857
In order to eat the lunch,
you first have to catch the lunch.

863
01:37:03,025 --> 01:37:05,276
And if we keep talking
instead of concentrating...

864
01:37:05,444 --> 01:37:06,820
...we're gonna catch nothing.

865
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:10,740
I have better idea. Why we
don't skip catching of lunch...

866
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,909
...and go right to eating of lunch?

867
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:16,246
I know wonderful place
just up coast from here...

868
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:19,374
...where they make fish stew.
Incredible.

869
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:25,338
They use tomatoes and onions,
and little amount of wild lavender.

870
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:27,924
What kind of wine?

871
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,884
Pink. From south.

872
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,012
A Châteauneuf, perhaps.

873
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:35,932
-Chilled.
-Of course, chilled.

874
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,059
And for dessert?
